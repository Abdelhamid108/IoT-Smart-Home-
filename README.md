# 🏠 Smart Home Project | IoT Network Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📘 Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Wireless Communication course**, where we designed a complete **Smart Home simulation** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The goal was to build a realistic, scalable, and secure smart home environment powered by IoT technologies and supported by a functional network infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design a secure and modular smart home architecture.
- Integrate IoT devices with automation logic.
- Simulate emergency handling using embedded systems.
- Enable remote access to critical components via cloud simulation.
- Create a hybrid (wired + wireless) network infrastructure.
- Emulate a full ISP and mobile access environment.

## 🧱 System Architecture

### 🖥️ Network Infrastructure

- **Home Gateway:** Central server for local devices (e.g., lights, fans).
- **Cloud ISP Simulation:** Enables remote access to critical components like cameras and doors.
- **Cell Towers:** Simulate smartphone access from outside the home.
- **Routers and Switches:** Manage wired and wireless connectivity.

## 🔌 IoT Devices Used

### 🧠 Sensors
- Motion sensors  
- Temperature sensors  
- Fire detectors  
- Smoke detectors  
- Water level sensors  
- Soil moisture sensors  
- Door and window sensors  

### ⚙️ Actuators & Smart Devices
- Smart lights  
- Smart fans  
- Sprinkler system  
- Water drainage system  
- Alarms  
- Surveillance cameras

## 🔄 IoT Automation Logic

Implemented via Cisco Packet Tracer’s **IoT Logic Editor**, including:

- Lights turn on based on motion and time (day/night).
- Fans activate when room temperature exceeds thresholds.
- Alarms trigger in “Away” mode upon motion detection.
- Lawn sprinklers activate based on soil moisture or schedule.
- Drainage pump turns on automatically when water level is high.
- Smoke detection triggers alarm and safety response.

## 🔥 Embedded System for Fire Response

We implemented a **local standalone embedded system** (using MCU modules) between fire detectors and sprinklers. This allows immediate reaction to fires **without relying on the central server**.

### ✅ Benefits:
- Instant local response  
- Reduced latency in emergencies  
- Network-independent safety  
- Follows real-world embedded safety standards  
- Modular design – scalable for large homes

## 🌐 Remote Access & Cloud Simulation

- Simulated ISP and DNS services
- Cloud access for sensitive devices (cameras, doors)
- Local server handles standard devices (lights, fans)
- Simulated mobile access via smartphone and tablet interfaces
- Web dashboard control interface simulated via HTML on Packet Tracer servers

---

## 🧩 Advanced Features

- **Smart Modes:** "Home" vs "Away" modes alter behavior dynamically.
- **Hybrid Network:** Wired + wireless mix for realistic conditions.
- **Room-Based Organization:** Devices grouped per room for clarity.
- **Multi-device Control:** Via PC, tablet, or smartphone.
- **Failover & Safety:** Fire response doesn’t rely on network stability.
