Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the IoT Smart Home system, a simulation-based modeling project for smart home environments. The system demonstrates the network architecture, device connectivity, communication protocols, and security implementations that would be found in a modern IoT-enabled smart home.

The system is primarily implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation purposes, allowing for realistic modeling of network interactions and device communications without requiring physical hardware deployment.

For detailed information about the system's architecture, see System Architecture, and for implementation specifics, refer to the Implementation Guide.

System Overview
The IoT Smart Home project establishes a comprehensive framework for connecting, monitoring, and controlling various smart devices within a residential environment. It demonstrates how different IoT devices can be integrated into a cohesive system with centralized management capabilities.
